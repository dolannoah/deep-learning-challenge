Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Predictor

This project uses a deep neural network to predict whether organizations applying for funding from Alphabet Soup will be successful. The goal is to help streamline the decision-making process by identifying strong candidates based on their application data.

Summary:
- Preprocessed the dataset by removing identifiers, encoding categorical features, and binning rare values
- Built and trained a neural network with four hidden layers
- Used a combination of ReLU and sigmoid activation functions
- Achieved a final test accuracy of 73%

Model:
- Increased layer depth from two to four
- Adjusted activation functions to improve learning
- Used 100 training epochs with validation monitoring
